## How it Works

The Speech Text Reader web application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's how it works:

### HTML Structure

The HTML structure defines the elements that make up the Speech Text Reader:

- A container for the user interface.
- Buttons for toggling the text box and reading text.
- A text box for entering text to be read.
- A dropdown for selecting voices.

### CSS Styling

The CSS styles define the visual appearance of the Speech Text Reader:

- Stylish buttons and text box.
- Responsive design for different screen sizes.
- Font imported from Google Fonts.

### JavaScript Functionality

The JavaScript code adds interactivity to the Speech Text Reader:

- Fetches available voices from the browser's speech synthesis API.

- Allows users to toggle the text box.
